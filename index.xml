      <title>Machine learning phases of matter</title>

&lt;p&gt;Identifying phase transitions and classifying phases of matter is central to understanding the properties
and behavior of a broad range of material systems. While many-body systems have a large number of degrees of freedom,
their phases are usually characterized by a small set of physical quantities like response functions or order parameters.
However, the identification of phases and the transitions between them generally involves a large state space, requiring
lots of intuition and knowledge about the underlying physical system. In this project, we develop and analyze machine-learning
methods to perform these tasks in a data-driven manner. Such methods can aid in the identification of unexplored phase transitions
as well as the discovery of new phases of matter.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Differentiable isospectral flows for matrix diagonalization</title>

&lt;p&gt;One of the most important problems in numerical analysis is the design of algorithms for solving the eigenvalue problem, i.e., to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a matrix. For a Hermitian matrix, this amounts to constructing a unitary transformation that brings it into a diagonal form. Traditional iterative algorithms, such as the Jacobi eigenvalue algorithm or the QR algorithm, accomplish this in a series of discrete steps. In the continuum limit, the unitary transformation is instead performed in a continuous fashion, as described by isospectral flows. Solving the ODEs modeling such an isospectral flow numerically in turn corresponds to an iterative eigenvalue algorithm. The QR algorithm, for example, emerges when sampling a particular isospectral flow at unit intervals. Eigenvalue algorithms based on continuous isospectral flows have proven particularly useful for studying closed quantum many-body systems whose properties are determined by their Hamiltonian - a Hermitian matrix whose dimension grows exponentially with the number of system constituents. In this case, the operator structure of typical physical Hamiltonians can be exploited to introduce approximations that enable the analysis of larger systems. In this project, we implement continuous isospectral flows in a differentiable manner in Julia. This allows for the efficient and accurate computation of derivatives of physical quantities of interest, such as (time-dependent) expectation values of observables, with respect to Hamiltonian parameters. The derivative information can be utilized to perform, e.g., parameter estimation, inverse Hamiltonian design, or sensitivity analysis.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Performance bounds for quantum control</title>
      <link>https://arnoldjulian.github.io/project/quantum_control/</link>

&lt;p&gt;Feedback control of devices at the quantum level holds
enormous potential for current and future applications in the
field of quantum information science. However, due
to the nonlinear and stochastic nature of quantum systems
under continuous observation this is a difficult task.
As such, heuristics, such as reinforcement learning or expert intuition, are often used for the design of quantum feedback controllers. While heuristically derived control policies are frequently found to perform
remarkably well in practice, their degree of suboptimality essentially always lacks quantification. In this project, we tackle this problem by combining quantum filtering theory and moment-sum-of-squares techniques to construct a hierarchy of convex optimization problems that furnish monotonically improving, computable bounds on the best attainable performance for a large class of quantum feedback control problems.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Machine learning molecular collisions</title>

&lt;p&gt;Predicting the outcomes of chemical reactions is one of the essential tasks for efficient material design and engineering. However, the exhaustive characterization of reactions at the microscopic state-to-state level quickly becomes computationally intractable using conventional approaches due to the rapid growth of the underlying state space. This is particularly restricting for the study of reactive gas flow at high temperatures, such as hypersonic flow around a space vehicle reentering the atmosphere, because a large number of states and transitions between them are accessible under such conditions. In addition, experimental data is scarce and the system is inherently nonequilibrium. In this project, we tackle this problem by training coarse-grained neural network-based surrogate models given data from ab initio reference simulations which predict the changes in energy and state population distributions upon collision.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Entropy production in ticking clocks</title>
      <link>https://arnoldjulian.github.io/project/ticking_clocks/</link>

&lt;p&gt;The concept of time and its role in physics, in particular quantum theory, remains an
active field of research. The process of timekeeping is linked to the usage of clocks
as reference systems. Thus, many open questions about time can be addressed
through the study of these devices. Ticking clocks provide information about the flow
of time in terms of discrete ``ticking&amp;rsquo;&amp;rsquo; events. In this project, we study autonomous
ticking clocks based on a model derived from axiomatic principles. We try to
answer the question whether the theory of quantum information imposes any
constraints on the relation between the entropy production per tick of a ticking clock
and its accuracy.&lt;/p&gt;
