 abstract = {How much do consumers care about freedom of association and collective bargaining rights and when does consumer demand for labor rights translate into ﬁrm proﬁts? We test the relative strength of consumer preferences over diﬀerent labor standards with a series of unique conjoint experiments embedded in a survey of more than 2,000 U.S. consumers. We employ a Bayesian approach to estimate consumer willingness to pay for garments produced in factories with good labor standards and to simulate how consumer enthusiasm translates into increased proﬁts for apparel ﬁrms. Our willingness to pay estimates suggest much higher demand for FACB rights, the payment of a living wage, and women’s empowerment than is commonly assumed in academic and policy circles. Our proﬁt simulations, however, demonstrate that the ability of competing ﬁrms to adopt similar marketing strategies can limit the proﬁts ﬂowing from this enthusiasm. Since respect for labor rights cannot be patented, the eﬀectiveness of ethical labeling depends heavily on the ability of ﬁrms to develop unique ways of incorporating respect for FACB rights into their branding strategies.},
