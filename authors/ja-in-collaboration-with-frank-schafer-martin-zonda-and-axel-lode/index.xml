      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;short-description&#34;&gt;Short description&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Identifying phase transitions and classifying phases of matter is central to understanding the properties
and behavior of a broad range of material systems. While many-body systems have a large number of degrees of freedom,
their phases are usually characterized by a small set of physical quantities like response functions or order parameters.
However, the identification of phases and the transitions between them generally involves a large state space, requiring
lots of intuition and knowledge about the underlying physical system. In this project, we develop and analyze machine-learning
methods to perform these tasks in a data-driven manner. Such methods can aid in the identification of unexplored phase transitions
as well as the discovery of new phases of matter.&lt;/p&gt;
