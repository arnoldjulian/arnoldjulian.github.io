While many-body systems have a large number of degrees of freedom, their phases are usually characterized by a small set of physical quantities like response functions or order parameters. However, the identification of phases and the transitions between them generally involves a large state space, requiring lots of intuition and knowledge about the underlying physical system. In this project, we develop and analyze machine-learning methods to perform these tasks in a data-driven manner. Such methods can aid in the identification of unexplored phase transitions as well as the discovery of new phases of matter.\n","date":1669766400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1669766400,"objectID":"87b99270282b7955a9b379cd8b686b37","permalink":"https://arnoldjulian.github.io/project/phase_transitions/","publishdate":"2022-11-30T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/phase_transitions/","section":"project","summary":"Using machine learning techniques to detect phase transitions autonomously from readily accessible data.","tags":["phase transition","phase of matter","machine learning","neural networks"],"title":"Machine learning phases of matter","type":"project"},{"authors":["JA in collaboration with Flemming Holtorf, Frank Schäfer, Christopher Rackauckas, and Alan Edelman"],"categories":null,"content":"Short description Feedback control of devices at the quantum level holds enormous potential for current and future applications in the field of quantum information science. However, due to the nonlinear and stochastic nature of quantum systems under continuous observation this is a difficult task. As such, heuristics, such as reinforcement learning or expert intuition, are often used for the design of quantum feedback controllers. While heuristically derived control policies are frequently found to perform remarkably well in practice, their degree of suboptimality essentially always lacks quantification. In this project, we tackle this problem by combining quantum filtering theory and moment-sum-of-squares techniques to construct a hierarchy of convex optimization problems that furnish monotonically improving, computable bounds on the best attainable performance for a large class of quantum feedback control problems.\n","date":1679270400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1679270400,"objectID":"a73e220ac0c700cd7a0a72bb831fcf38","permalink":"https://arnoldjulian.github.io/project/quantum_control/","publishdate":"2023-03-20T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/quantum_control/","section":"project","summary":"Bounding the best attainable performance for quantum feedback control problems using moment-sum-of-squares techniques.","tags":["quantum control","sum-of-squares","bounds","optimal"],"title":"Performance bounds for quantum control","type":"project"},{"authors":["JA in collaboration with Debasish Koner, Juan Carlos San Vicente Veliz, Narendra Singh, Raymond Bemish, Silvan Käser, and Markus Meuwly"],"categories":null,"content":"Short description Predicting the outcomes of chemical reactions is one of the essential tasks for efficient material design and engineering. However, the exhaustive characterization of reactions at the microscopic state-to-state level quickly becomes computationally intractable using conventional approaches due to the rapid growth of the underlying state space. This is particularly restricting for the study of reactive gas flow at high temperatures, such as hypersonic flow around a space vehicle reentering the atmosphere, because a large number of states and transitions between them are accessible under such conditions. In addition, experimental data is scarce and the system is inherently nonequilibrium. In this project, we tackle this problem by training coarse-grained neural network-based surrogate models given data from ab initio reference simulations which predict the changes in energy and state population distributions upon collision.\n","date":1669766400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1669766400,"objectID":"a6c08a66b260851fe978b511944c267b","permalink":"https://arnoldjulian.github.io/project/molecular_collisions/","publishdate":"2022-11-30T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/molecular_collisions/","section":"project","summary":"Modelling changes in energy and state population distributions of molecular systems undergoing collisions using machine learning methods.","tags":["chemical reaction","hypersonic flow","machine learning","neural networks"],"title":"Machine learning molecular collisions","type":"project"},{"authors":["JA in collaboration with Mischa Woods, Christoph Bruder, and Renato Renner"],"categories":null,"content":"Short description The concept of time and its role in physics, in particular quantum theory, remains an active field of research. The process of timekeeping is linked to the usage of clocks as reference systems. Thus, many open questions about time can be addressed through the study of these devices. Ticking clocks provide information about the flow of time in terms of discrete ``ticking’’ events. In this project, we study autonomous ticking clocks based on a model derived from axiomatic principles. We try to answer the question whether the theory of quantum information imposes any constraints on the relation between the entropy production per tick of a ticking clock and its accuracy.\n","date":1669766400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1669766400,"objectID":"3712d240fbb76bc238d123c93b76ec4e","permalink":"https://arnoldjulian.github.io/project/ticking_clocks/","publishdate":"2022-11-30T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/ticking_clocks/","section":"project","summary":"Studying the relation between the entropy production per tick of ticking clocks and their accuracy.","tags":["ticking clocks","entropy","quantum information"],"title":"Entropy production in ticking clocks","type":"project"}]
